# Phase 1 Restoration Notes

Date: 2026-04-30

## Root cause of the route freeze

`apps/api/src/lib/queue.ts` exported five Redis-backed objects as
**module-level constants**:

```ts
export const outboundSyncQueue = new Queue(...)
export const channelSyncQueue  = new Queue(...)
export const stockUpdateQueue  = new Queue(...)
export const queueEvents             = new QueueEvents(...)
export const channelSyncQueueEvents  = new QueueEvents(...)
```

`new Queue(...)` opens a Redis connection synchronously at construction. Any
route file that imported `lib/queue.ts` — directly or transitively through a
service — therefore tried to connect to Redis the moment Node loaded the
module graph, before `app.listen` was reached. On Railway, `REDIS_URL` was
not yet on `process.env` at module-load time, so the boot crashed and routes
had to be commented out one-by-one as a stopgap.

## Fix: fully lazy queue.ts

`apps/api/src/lib/queue.ts` was rewritten so that **nothing** in the module
opens a Redis connection at load time. The Redis client, all three queues,
and both QueueEvents are created on first access via internal getters
(`getRedisConnection`, `getOutboundSyncQueue`, …). The named exports stay
the same — `outboundSyncQueue`, `channelSyncQueue`, `stockUpdateQueue`,
`queueEvents`, `channelSyncQueueEvents` — but they are now `Proxy` wrappers
that resolve to the real instance on the first method call. Existing call
sites (`outboundSyncQueue.add(...)`, `await stockUpdateQueue.close()`, etc.)
require no changes.

`initializeQueue()` and `closeQueue()` were updated to drive the getters
explicitly so workers/health checks still work when Phase 2 enables them.

## Files refactored

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `apps/api/src/lib/queue.ts` | Full lazy rewrite; queues + QueueEvents now Proxy-backed singletons |
| `apps/api/src/routes/catalog-safe.routes.ts` | Trimmed to `/amazon/import` only — the rest collided with the now re-enabled `catalog.routes.ts` |
| `apps/api/src/index.ts` | Re-enabled all 20 disabled route imports + registrations |

## Routes re-enabled

All twenty previously commented-out routes are now registered:

- `listingsRoutes`
- `aiRoutes`
- `marketplaceRoutes`
- `adminRoutes`
- `monitoringRoutes`
- `shopifyRoutes`, `shopifyWebhookRoutes`
- `woocommerceRoutes`, `woocommerceWebhookRoutes`
- `estyRoutes`, `estyWebhookRoutes`
- `ebayAuthRoutes`, `ebayRoutes`, `ebayOrdersRoutes`
- `catalogRoutes` (under `/api/catalog`)
- `outboundRoutes`
- `matrixRoutes`
- `inboundRoutes`
- `webhookRoutes`
- `ordersRoutes`

Plus the routes that were already enabled: `inventoryRoutes`, `syncRoutes`,
`catalogSafeRoutes`, `healthRoutes`, `amazonRoutes`.

## Still disabled (intentional — Phase 2)

The HTTP layer is fully restored, but BullMQ infrastructure is still gated:

- `startJobs()` — node-cron job dispatch
- `initializeQueue()` — Redis ping + counts
- `initializeBullMQWorker()`
- `initializeChannelSyncWorker()`
- `initializeBulkListWorker()`
- `closeQueue()` on SIGTERM/SIGINT

These are commented out in `apps/api/src/index.ts`. Phase 2 will turn them
back on once `REDIS_URL` is verified on Railway.

## Breaking changes

**One.** `catalog-safe.routes.ts` lost three endpoints to avoid a Fastify
`FST_ERR_DUPLICATED_ROUTE` crash when both catalog files registered under
`/api/catalog`. The endpoints removed from the safe file were already
duplicates with the same behavior in the full `catalog.routes.ts`:

| Endpoint | Now served by |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/catalog/ebay/import` | `catalog.routes.ts:1503` |
| `GET  /api/catalog/ebay/stats`  | `catalog.routes.ts:1539` |
| `DELETE /api/catalog/products/:id` | `catalog.routes.ts:797` (cascading delete) |

`POST /api/catalog/amazon/import` stays in `catalog-safe.routes.ts` — it has
no equivalent in the full file.

## Verification

Local boot test (`apps/api`, `REDIS_PORT=1` to make Redis unreachable):

- `tsc --noEmit` clean
- All 20 disabled route files import without opening a Redis connection
- Server boots in ~150ms with all routes registered
- No `FST_ERR_DUPLICATED_ROUTE`
- No module-load Redis errors

The `/api/health` endpoint returns 503 when the database is unreachable —
that is the existing behavior (it does a `SELECT 1` round-trip), unrelated
to the queue refactor.

## Next steps

1. Deploy `main` to Railway and tail logs for any module-load Redis errors.
2. Hit `/api/health`, `/api/inventory`, `/api/catalog/...` to confirm 200s.
3. Phase 2: re-enable workers and `initializeQueue()` once Railway env is
   confirmed.
