# Remaining channel work — active implementation

Scope remains Amazon, eBay and Etsy; preserve connected Shopify. Last verified
production code is `439d9e3d3`. This record distinguishes new local work from that
deployed release. No new deployment, vendor probe or channel activation is approved
by a local implementation result.

## C9 — atomic receipt identity

**Implemented and independently reviewed locally; not deployed.**

The old `recordInbound` checked for a row before inserting it. A barrier-controlled
real PostgreSQL test forced two first deliveries to reach insertion together: the
loser returned a null receipt instead of the row the winner had stored. Additional
tests showed that a repeated delivery ID could reuse another account/topic/verifier's
receipt, and the helper copied arbitrary persistence exception text into its log.
The initial reproduction was **four failed / two passed / zero skipped**.

One `createMany(skipDuplicates:true)` insertion now lets the database's scoped unique
key choose the first receipt. A generated UUID supplies the ID without a preceding
read. UUIDs fit the existing String/TEXT column and route contract. A duplicate uses
one atomic update guarded by the scoped key, account (including null), event type,
signature verdict and verifier. It increments only `deliveries` and returns the
winner's current ID/status. Identity conflicts return no usable receipt ID. Other
persistence failures also refuse acknowledgment; the helper logs only a safe error
code. The first payload, digest, provider time, outcome, retry count and backoff are
preserved even when retry delivery metadata changes.

This uses Prisma 6's supported PostgreSQL `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` path:
https://docs.prisma.io/docs/orm/v6/prisma-client/queries/crud . It avoids expected
duplicate INSERT exceptions reaching Prisma's error logger with the incoming payload.
Failure-injection tests prove sanitization of this helper's own diagnostic output;
they do **not** prove global redaction of every unexpected Prisma error.

Tradeoff: null-to-owned receipt rebinding is now explicitly refused, as is switching
an existing receipt between accounts. Recovery requires a separate, verified routing
operation; it must not silently rewrite provenance. This slice preserves the stored
payload but does not yet replace legacy inline handlers with stored-payload dispatch.
Durable eBay claims, domain effects and replay remain the next work.

Proof after review: **eight real PostgreSQL tests pass, zero skips**, including two
simultaneous inserts, twelve concurrent redeliveries, two-profile separation, account/
topic/trust/null identity conflicts, failed duplicate updates, and changed retry
metadata preservation. **70 existing ledger/retry/Shopify/Etsy tests pass**; only their
database mocks were adapted, with every assertion retained. API typecheck passed.
The canonical PostgreSQL runner now mandates these eight cases (114 total expected).

Applied/restored mutations: removing duplicate-conflict handling caused **five failed /
three passed**; removing the account guard caused **two failed / six passed**. Both
restored byte-for-byte. Independent review approved; its stronger payload-preservation
control was added and the eight PostgreSQL cases reran green afterward.

Evidence under `/private/tmp/cx-completion-20260922/`: `receipt-race-red.log`,
`receipt-race-reviewed.log`, `receipt-regressions.log`, `c9-typecheck.log`,
`c9-insert-conflict-mutation.log`, `c9-receipt-account-mutation.log`. The failed real-DB
reports are retained by the runner. All database work used disposable localhost
PostgreSQL; no production operation or vendor call was made for this slice.
