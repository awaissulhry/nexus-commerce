# EP — the Enterprise Program (page-by-page hardening · multi-session control tower)

Started 2026-07-11 at the Owner's direction: *"work page by page to make sure it's absolutely enterprise level … no communication gap at all … complete control over each and everything … no duplicate features … keep control of each and everything."* This file is the **coordination contract for every session** working on Factory OS from now on. Read it right after `PLAYBOOK.md`, before touching any page.

## The protocol (binding on every session)

1. **Claim before you work.** Before starting a page, set its row below to `CLAIMED (date)` and commit this file (`git commit --only docs/factory/ENTERPRISE-PROGRAM.md`) — parallel sessions on main make unclaimed parallel work a collision risk. If a row is already CLAIMED, do not touch that page; coordinate through the Owner.
2. **Per-page cycle (double gate, unchanged):** research (external bar + internal audit) → `EPx-PROPOSAL.md` → Owner approval → phase specs → build → click-through → Owner approval → update the row.
   **Research completeness standard (Owner directive 2026-07-11):** the internal audit must include a TOTAL UI inventory — every surface (page, tab, modal, drawer, banner, empty state, toast), every control (button, link, menu item, field, keyboard shortcut) with its full wiring chain (handler → API route → service → DB writes → events/notifications emitted), and every navigation edge in and out of the page. Deliverable: `EPx-UI-INVENTORY.md` committed beside the proposal. "The wiring, the links, the buttons — each and everything."
3. **No feature leaves its home page.** A capability belongs to the page that owns its entity (registry below). If a page needs something another page owns, it consumes that page's API/components — it never re-implements. New cross-page capabilities get an owner ROW here first.
4. **Shared substrate is owned by workstreams, not pages** (table below). A page proposal may DEPEND on substrate; it may not BUILD it.
5. **Navigation law:** the 11-page IA (F0-IA.md) is fixed; new surfaces live INSIDE their page (tabs/drawers/sub-routes like `/quotes/...`). Adding a top-level nav item requires Owner sign-off recorded here. **Signed off: `/chat` (12th item) — approved by the Owner via FS-FC-PROPOSAL, 2026-07-11 ("proceed with your recommendation"); built in FC2.**
6. **Design law:** DS-only UI (F0-DESIGN-BRIDGE.md); resizable panes + windowed lists are the standing expectations for any new heavy surface.
7. **Shared visual map (Obsidian, added 2026-07-16 at the Owner's direction):** `obsidian-vault/Factory/` — `F00 - Factory OS MOC` hub, one note per page/substrate, `Factory OS Map.canvas` (wiring) + `EP Status Board.canvas` (status columns). When your page's registry row changes, update YOUR page note + move your card on the status board in the same commit (`git add obsidian-vault/Factory && git commit --only obsidian-vault/Factory --only <your docs>`). The vault is a MAP for the Owner; this file and `docs/factory/` remain the canon and win on any conflict. The AWA workbook privacy rule applies in the vault too: structure only, never figures.

| FTS search, attachment/PDF streaming, snapshot & archival | **FS5** | **SHIPPED 2026-07-17 (worktree): FTS5 substrate — migration `fs5_fts` (authored NOT applied; ⚠ merging session runs `db:migrate`, Owner restarts :3100 web+worker per 6b; tables declared external in prisma.config.ts so `migrate dev` never drops them) + `search-fts.ts` helpers + ⌘K rewired with pre-migration LIKE fallback · streamed quote PDFs (route) · snapshot hardening (wal_checkpoint before VACUUM INTO, AppSetting `snapshot.config` hour/keep, `snapshot.last` stamp; measured 5.5 s at 1.2 GB) · streamed full-table ledger+audit archival exports + `FS5-RETENTION.md` + `fts:rebuild` restore script.

## Cross-review 2026-07-16 (`EP-CROSSREVIEW.md`) — coordination rows + amendments attached to the open gates

First adversarial review of the four proposals against each other (EPF session, program coordination). Verdict: conditionally approvable — no phase re-scoping, but these ownership rows are now BINDING and the per-session one-liners must land in the respective specs:

| Capability | Owner | Consumers / condition |
|---|---|---|
| `MessageTemplate` store (variables incl. `{{quote.number}}`/`{{order.number}}`, IT/EN) | **EPI** (EPI.4) | EPQ.2 follow-ups, EPF.4 dunning, EPO.6 transition drafts — configured instances of ONE shared cadence/`FollowUpTask` engine; nobody builds a second template store or queue (B1) |
| Per-entity open-param table (URL law, extends EPO D-5) | **EPO** | `?o=` /orders · `?c=` /contacts · `?q=` /quotes · `?focus=` /inbox ONLY · `?party=` cross-page · `?from=&to=` (Rome TZ) house date-range. EPI must fix its `/contacts?id=` + `/orders?focus=` links (B2, code-verified broken) |
| Money-event notifications (payment/invoice `notify()`) | **EPF** | added ONCE in shared FP9/payments routes; EPO owns lifecycle-state notifications (M3) |
| Exception-queue split | **EPO** = fulfillment/promise (late, at-risk, stalled WO, production-blocking deposit) · **EPF** = billing/AR (deposit terms absent, margin-floor, unbilled, unapplied, money-on-cancelled) | each links to the other, no duplicate predicates (M2) |
| OrderDetail tab host | **EPO.6 scaffolds** | FC2 mounts into it — FC1 spec must not re-claim it (M4) |
| Return credits | **EPF's CreditNote API** mints the document | EPO.5 calls it, records only return linkage (M10) |
| `SavedView` schema steward | **EPF** (richest tuple: filters+group-by+sort+columns+aggregate+default) | EPQ.6/EPO.7 consume (M12) |
| Interim concurrency/idempotency guards (`updatedAt` 409, idempotency keys, collision-pause) | granted per-page **pending FS4** | FS4 consolidates on claim (M1) |

**Sequencing (binding): EPF.1 gates EPO.2** — the order-board money strip embeds the fold only after EPF.1's semantics fixes (B3). **Per-session one-liners still owed:** EPI — fix outbound params (B2); EPO — `import.finished` in EPO.7 + publish `order-summary` for EPI.6 or bless its read (M6/M9); EPQ — quotes-grid VirtualDataGrid ✅ shipped in EPQ.3 (M7); ConvertBar backlink named in EPQ.6 (M8). EPF's amendments are applied (`EPF-PROPOSAL.md` §9; compliance ⚠ flags superseded by `EPF-COMPLIANCE.md`).

## Standing cross-page invariants (program-wide)

- Money truth lives in the pure folds (`rollup.ts`, `money.ts`, quote engine) — pages feed them, never fork them; parity script guards every rewrite.
- Every list bounded (`check:query-bounds`), every heavy page proven on the FS0 harness before its gate closes.
- Communication events (send/accept/state changes) must land in BOTH the Gmail thread (external) and — once FC ships — the order/quote's internal feed; no silent state changes, ever. "No communication gap" is an exit criterion for every EP page.
- **Deep-link URL law (per-entity params, established across EPO/EPQ/EPI):** a page reads its OWN single param — `/inbox?focus=` · `/quotes?q=` · `/orders?o=` · `/contacts?c=` · `/shipping?buy=` · `/production?wo=` (EPO.3). **Brand scoping = `?party=<id>` (EPO.7, D-5)**: any page that lists party-owned entities scopes on it and shows a dismissible chip; NO global brand switcher; party-360 stays /contacts (EPC). `/api/search` emits these params (never `?focus=` for non-inbox). New pages honor their param + `?party=` when applicable.
- Playbook rules unchanged: no-touch, scoped commits, no time estimates, honest gate reports.
