# Purchase orders (PO-series)

End-to-end documentation of the 18-phase `/fulfillment/purchase-orders` rebuild
shipped 2026-05-23 → 2026-05-24. This document is the canonical reference for
operators, future agents working on the surface, and anyone wiring an external
integration to the PO API.

```

- Forward only. The only backward edge is `cancel`, allowed up to APPROVED.
- Auto-advance through REVIEW when **all** conditions hold:
  - `BrandSettings.requireApprovalForPo` is false **AND**
  - `BrandSettings.poApprovalThresholdCents` is null OR `totalCents ≤ threshold`
- Above-threshold POs stop at REVIEW. Approver email (when set) surfaces in the
  UI; PO.9 email automation for approvers is out of scope.
- `PARTIAL`/`RECEIVED` are driven by `inbound.service.syncPoState()` after each
  goods receipt, not by the workflow service.

## Auto-close tolerance + PPV (PO.10)

Configured by env vars (no schema migration):

| Var                                       | Default | Effect                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEXUS_PO_AUTO_CLOSE_TOLERANCE_UNITS`     | `0`     | When `ordered − received ≤ tolerance`, PO closes to RECEIVED instead of staying PARTIAL.    |
| `NEXUS_PO_PPV_WARNING_BP`                 | `200`   | Per-line price-variance threshold in basis points (200 = 2%). UI flags lines above this.    |

## Real-time (PO.4)

In-process event bus + SSE endpoint:

- `publishPoEvent({ type, poId, … })` from `po-events.service.ts`
- `GET /api/fulfillment/purchase-orders/events` — SSE stream, 25s heartbeat
- Event types: `po.created`, `po.updated`, `po.transitioned`, `po.deleted`,
  `po.restored`, `po.received`

Frontend subscriber: `apps/web/src/lib/sync/use-po-events.ts`. Events re-emit
through the shared `nexus:invalidations` BroadcastChannel so every open tab
refreshes within ~200ms of a peer mutation.

### Public (token-gated)

| Method | Path                                  | Purpose                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/po/ack/:token`                      | Supplier-side read-only view of the PO (PO.9)                  |

## CSV format (PO.15)

Required columns:

```
groupKey, sku, quantityOrdered
```

Optional columns:

```
supplierName, supplierId, warehouseCode, expectedDeliveryDate (YYYY-MM-DD),
currencyCode, unitCostCents, lineNote
```

- Rows with the same `groupKey` form one PO. The first row of each group sets
  the supplier / warehouse / expected date / currency; subsequent rows in the
  same group only contribute their line item.
- Blank `groupKey` rows carry over to the most-recently-seen group within the
  upload.
- Suppliers are matched by name (case-insensitive); unknown names create a PO
  without a supplier and the preview surfaces a warning.

## Italian fiscal (PO.12)

The factory PDF and detail page both render an Imponibile / IVA / Totale block
when `BrandSettings.piva` is set. Configuration:

| Field                         | Where                       | Effect                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `piva`                        | BrandSettings               | P.IVA shown on PDF letterhead + detail strip                  |
| `codiceFiscale`               | BrandSettings               | C.F. shown alongside P.IVA                                    |
| `sdiCode`                     | BrandSettings               | SDI code shown alongside P.IVA                                |
| `vatScheme`                   | BrandSettings               | Tag on the detail strip                                       |
| `NEXUS_DEFAULT_IVA_RATE_BP`   | env (default 2200)          | IVA rate in basis points (2200 = 22% standard)                |

Reverse-charge logic (DPR 633/72 Art. 17(6)):

- Supplier in IT → standard IVA at rate
- Supplier in EU-non-IT (DE, FR, etc.) → reverse charge: IVA = 0, banner shown
- Supplier in extra-EU (CN, US) → IVA = 0 (customs-handled)

PDF locales:

- Italian suppliers → `it`
- CN / HK / TW suppliers → `zh`
- Everything else → `en`

Override with `?locale=en|it|zh` on the factory PDF URL.

Deferred from PO.12:

- DDT (Documento di Trasporto) printable for supplier returns
- Nota di credito hookup

## Approval ladder (PO.7)

The pre-PO.7 boolean `requireApprovalForPo` is preserved. PO.7 layered a
value-based threshold on top of it.

Resolution order (in `po-workflow.service.ts:transitionPo`):

1. `requireApprovalForPo === true` → always stop at REVIEW
2. `poApprovalThresholdCents !== null && totalCents > threshold` → stop at REVIEW
3. Otherwise → auto-advance REVIEW → APPROVED on submit-for-review

Approver email (`poApprovalApproverEmail`) surfaces in the company-settings UI;
explicit notification email to the approver is deferred to a follow-up (would
naturally live in `po-supplier-email.service.ts` as a sibling template).

## Supplier ack URL (PO.9)

When the operator transitions APPROVED → SUBMITTED via `transition('send')`:

1. `po-supplier-email.service:sendPoToSupplier` mints a 256-bit URL-safe token
2. Writes `supplierAckToken` + `supplierAckExpiresAt` (default 30d via
   `NEXUS_PO_ACK_TTL_DAYS`)
3. Sends an HTML+text email via the existing shared `sendEmail` transport
   (Resend; dry-run unless `NEXUS_ENABLE_OUTBOUND_EMAILS=true`)
4. Returns the ack URL on the transition response so the detail page can
   surface it inline (Copy button)

Supplier-side `/po/ack/:token` page:

- No auth, no app chrome — just the PO summary + confirm/decline panel
- Confirm flips PO to ACKNOWLEDGED + writes `supplierConfirmedDeliveryDate`
- Decline flips PO to CANCELLED + revokes the token

Token rotates on every send. PO.8 revisions don't auto-rotate the token; the
operator must hit Send again on the revised PO to mint a fresh URL.

## Saved views + filters (PO.14)

Built-in view chips on the toolbar (no per-user persistence yet):

- **Late POs** — `?lateOnly=true`
- **Awaiting approval** — `?status=REVIEW`
- **Deliveries this week** — `?expectedFrom=<today>&expectedTo=<+7d>` (computed at apply-time)
- **Drafts** — `?status=DRAFT`
- **Received** — `?status=RECEIVED`

Advanced filters popover handles supplier multi-select, warehouse, currency,
value range, expected-delivery range, and the late-only toggle. Every filter is
URL-state-driven; share the URL to share the view.

## AI assists (PO.17)

Gated by `NEXUS_AI_KILL_SWITCH` (truthy = AI off for all surfaces). Provider
selection via `AI_PROVIDER` env (anthropic / gemini); falls back to whichever
is configured.

- **Natural-language draft** — purple banner at the top of the Create-PO modal.
  Calls `POST /ai-draft`, fuzzy-matches supplier name, resolves dates
  ("Friday", "next Tuesday") to YYYY-MM-DD, pre-fills the form.
- **Cost-anomaly chip** — per line, when current unit cost deviates from the
  trailing-N PO average by > 5%. Click to apply the average.
- **EOQ chip** — per line, when SKU is bound to a catalog product. Reads
  `ReplenishmentRecommendation.reorderQuantity`. Click to apply.

Deferred from PO.17: EN↔IT bilingual translation of operator notes.

## Permissioning

V0 is permissive — any operator can:

- Approve / send / cancel any PO
- Delete any comment (including others')
- Open / apply / cancel revisions
- Send POs to suppliers (rotates the ack token; old URLs invalidate)

PO.18 polish defers per-action authorization until a user model + roles ship
across the rest of the app.

## Deferred items (across the series)

These remain backlog. Each is a meaningful engagement on its own.

| Item                                          | Originally scoped in | Why deferred                                      |
