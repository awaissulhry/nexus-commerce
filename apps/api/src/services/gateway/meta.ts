/**
 * Meta on the gateway (Meta ads M1, 2026-10-20): the ONE way Nexus calls Meta (Graph and Marketing API at
 * graph.facebook.com). Reads are GETs (metaCall); a change (step 17) is a POST of a form body (metaWriteCall) that the
 * gateway lets through only when it is on its write allow-list and its object is of the business's chosen ad account
 * (meta-calls.ts metaWriteVerdict, gateway.ts 3b). Step 23: a video's link handed to Meta's resumable upload host
 * (metaRuploadCall, rupload.facebook.com — judged in meta-media-rules.ts; Nexus sends no video byte).
 *
 * - `path` is below the pinned version (services/meta/api-version.ts): `me`, `act_123/campaigns`, `debug_token`.
 * - `query` values are sent as Meta reads them: text as is, a list or an object as JSON (`fields` may be a list).
 * - Auth: the account's own system-user token ('account', the default — the token service holds it and its app
 *   secret, the gateway adds `access_token` + `appsecret_proof`); the account's Meta app token ('app', for
 *   `debug_token`); a token and app secret the caller holds (the connect-time check, before a connection holds them);
 *   or none (the token renewal, which carries the app's id and secret itself).
 * - Paging: follow `paging.cursors.after` with the same path and query (`after=`), never `paging.next` — Meta's next
 *   link carries the token, and the gateway refuses a URL that names one.
 * - A read is retried once after a network error or a 5xx (the gateway's rule for reads); a throttle is never retried
 *   here: Meta answers it with HTTP 400 and a code, and asks callers to stop (rate-readings.ts metaRateReading).
